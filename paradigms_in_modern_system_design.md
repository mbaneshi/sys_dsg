### Modern Software System Design Paradigms

1. **Monolithic Architecture**: A single, unified software application.
2. **Microservices Architecture**: Independent, loosely coupled services that communicate over a network.
3. **Serverless Architecture**: Abstracts infrastructure management, focusing on code deployment.
4. **Event-Driven Architecture**: Systems respond to events asynchronously, improving scalability.
5. **Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA)**: Allows integration and interaction of distributed services.
6. **Domain-Driven Design (DDD)**: Emphasizes collaboration and modeling of complex domains.
7. **Component-Based Architecture**: Reusable and self-contained components within the system.
8. **Reactive Architecture**: Systems that are responsive, resilient, and elastic.
9. **Layered Architecture**: Separates concerns into layers (presentation, business logic, data).
10. **Peer-to-Peer Architecture**: Decentralized approach where peers share resources directly.
